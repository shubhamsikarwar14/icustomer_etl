# Optimization Techniques for Data Retrieval Queries

## Indexing 
Create an index on the timestamp column to speed up the grouping and sorting operations.

## Partitioning
If the table grows large, consider partitioning the table by date to speed up the queries.

## General Optimization Techniques

### Use Appropriate Data Types

Ensure that the columns are using the most appropriate data types to reduce storage and increase retrieval speed.

### Query Caching

Implement query caching mechanisms for frequently run queries to reduce the load on the database.

## Total Number of Interactions per Day

Create an index on the user_interactions column to speed up the grouping and sorting operations.
### SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON user_interactions(timestamp);

## Top 5 Users by Number of Interactions
Create an index on the user_id column to speed up the grouping and sorting operations.

### SQL
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON user_interactions(user_id);

## Most Interacted Products Based on Number of Interactions

Create an index on the product_id column to speed up the grouping and sorting operations.

### SQL

CREATE INDEX idx_product_id ON user_interactions(product_id);
